                <p>Volunteering at an orphanage is a rewarding but also challenging thing to do during your travels abroad. There are many children in Africa, Asia and South America who have been abandoned by their families for financial, social or personal reasons and live in a children's home. This is your chance to support the community.

                    As the well-being and the protection of the children are the main concerns at all times, volunteers are chosen very carefully and must be trained in working with children. A commitment of at least four weeks is mandatory for all orphanage volunteers. You will assist the main caretakers and help to provide a better future for the children.</p>
                  <p>Despite being a natural paradise, thousands of children are forced to live a life of an orphan in Nepal. This is due to rampant poverty, illiteracy, political instability and many other tragic circumstances. These helpless children are forced to find a shelter in the orphanages. The orphanages try everything possible to comfort them with basic needs. However, the poor children have not been getting adequate support as the orphanages lack sufficient staff and fund.</p>
